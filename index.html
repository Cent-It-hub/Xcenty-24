                <h3>Year 1</h3>
                <p>My first year was more of a kaleidoscope of sensations, emotions and milestones. From the warmth of my mother's embrace to th sound of my fathers soothing voice,
                    I began to discover the world. First cry, smiles, laughters and words marked my growth, while tiny hands and teeth explored textures and temperatures.
                sorrounded by love, i took tentative steps fueled by curiosity and wonder. This foundational year shaped me, layin the ground work of fro a lifetime of learning, relationships and adventure.</p>

                <h3>Year 3</h3>
                <p>Three-year-old me was a bundle of energy, a whirlwind of curiosity, and a staunch defender of my personal style. Refusing to don shirts, I asserted my independence and unique taste, a testament to my strong personality.
                    My loving father, ever patient and supportive, nurtured my individuality while gently guiding me toward societal norms. He understood my resistance to shirts might stem from a desire for comfort or a sense of control over my own body.    </p>
